# B+ Tree Verification Plan: Lean → Verified Rust

## Current Status ✅
- ✅ Basic B+ Tree structure defined
- ✅ Comprehensive invariants specified (wellFormed, key ranges, balanced depth)
- ✅ Operation signatures with correctness theorems
- ✅ Builds successfully with clear proof obligations

## Phase 1: Complete Foundation Proofs (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Termination Proofs
- [ ] **Priority 1**: Complete `allKeysInSubtree` termination proof
  ```lean
  -- Need: child ∈ children → sizeOf child < sizeOf (internal keys children)
  -- Use: List.sizeOf_lt_of_mem + constructor size properties
  ```
- [ ] Add structural recursion lemmas for BPlusNode
- [ ] Prove size relationships for all recursive functions

### 1.2 Helper Function Implementation
- [ ] Implement `minKeyInSubtree` with termination proof
- [ ] Implement `maxKeyInSubtree` with termination proof
- [ ] Prove properties: `minKeyInSubtree` returns actual minimum key
- [ ] Prove properties: `maxKeyInSubtree` returns actual maximum key

### 1.3 Enhanced Invariants
- [ ] Complete `keyRangesValid` with proper key separation proofs
- [ ] Add invariant: all leaves at same depth implies balanced tree
- [ ] Prove `wellFormed` is decidable for executable verification

## Phase 2: Core Operation Implementation (Week 3-5)

### 2.1 Search Operation
```lean
def search (tree : BPlusTree K V order) (key : K) : Option V
```
- [ ] Implement recursive search with path tracking
- [ ] Prove termination (using tree height or structure)
- [ ] Prove functional correctness: returns value iff key exists
- [ ] Prove complexity: O(log n) comparisons

### 2.2 Insert Operation  
```lean
def insert (tree : BPlusTree K V order) (key : K) (value : V) : BPlusTree K V order
```
- [ ] Implement leaf insertion
- [ ] Implement node splitting when full
- [ ] Implement parent key propagation
- [ ] Handle root splitting (tree height increase)
- [ ] Prove `insert` preserves `wellFormed`
- [ ] Prove complexity: O(log n) amortized

### 2.3 Delete Operation
```lean  
def delete (tree : BPlusTree K V order) (key : K) : BPlusTree K V order
```
- [ ] Implement leaf deletion
- [ ] Implement node merging when underfull
- [ ] Implement key redistribution between siblings
- [ ] Handle root merging (tree height decrease)
- [ ] Prove `delete` preserves `wellFormed`
- [ ] Prove complexity: O(log n) amortized

### 2.4 Range Query Operation
```lean
def rangeQuery (tree : BPlusTree K V order) (startKey endKey : K) : List (KeyValue K V)
```
- [ ] Implement leaf-to-leaf traversal
- [ ] Prove result is sorted by key
- [ ] Prove all returned keys in range [startKey, endKey]
- [ ] Prove complexity: O(log n + k) where k = result size

## Phase 3: Correctness Theorem Proofs (Week 6-7)

### 3.1 Functional Correctness
- [ ] `search_correct`: search finds iff key exists
- [ ] `insert_preserves_wellformed`: wellFormed invariant maintained
- [ ] `delete_preserves_wellformed`: wellFormed invariant maintained  
- [ ] `operations_commute`: independent operations commute

### 3.2 Performance Guarantees
- [ ] `height_logarithmic`: tree height ≤ log_b(n) where b = order/2
- [ ] `operation_complexity`: all ops O(log n) worst case
- [ ] `space_optimal`: space usage O(n) with proper fill factor

### 3.3 Advanced Properties
- [ ] `persistence`: immutable operations preserve old versions
- [ ] `concurrent_safety`: operations are linearizable
- [ ] `crash_consistency`: WAL-based durability properties

## Phase 4: Code Generation Pipeline (Week 8-9)

### 4.1 Lean Code Extraction
```bash
# Option A: Use Lean's built-in code generation
lean --c BPlusTreeLean.lean
```
- [ ] Configure Lean codegen for efficient C output
- [ ] Add FFI bindings for Rust interop
- [ ] Benchmark generated code performance

### 4.2 Direct Rust Translation (Recommended)
- [ ] Create verified translation rules: Lean → Rust
- [ ] Implement translation for:
  - BPlusNode → Rust enum
  - wellFormed → runtime assertion macros  
  - Operations → Rust impl blocks
- [ ] Preserve proof obligations as debug assertions

### 4.3 Rust Integration
```rust
// Generated Rust code structure:
pub struct BPlusTree<K: Ord, V, const ORDER: usize> {
    root: BPlusNode<K, V, ORDER>,
    height: usize,
}

impl<K: Ord, V, const ORDER: usize> BPlusTree<K, V, ORDER> {
    #[ensures(well_formed(&result))]
    pub fn new() -> Self { /* verified implementation */ }
    
    #[requires(well_formed(self))]
    #[ensures(well_formed(self))]
    pub fn search(&self, key: &K) -> Option<&V> { /* verified implementation */ }
}
```

## Phase 5: Testing & Benchmarking (Week 10)

### 5.1 Property-Based Testing
- [ ] Generate random B+ Tree operations
- [ ] Verify all invariants hold after each operation
- [ ] Compare against reference implementation

### 5.2 Performance Validation  
- [ ] Benchmark against std::collections::BTreeMap
- [ ] Verify O(log n) complexity empirically
- [ ] Memory usage profiling

### 5.3 Real-World Integration
- [ ] Database storage engine integration
- [ ] Concurrent access patterns
- [ ] Persistence and recovery testing

## Success Criteria

✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: All `sorry` replaced with proofs, builds without warnings

✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: All operations implemented with correctness proofs

✅ **Phase 3 Complete**: All invariant preservation theorems proven

✅ **Phase 4 Complete**: Rust code generated with verified properties

✅ **Phase 5 Complete**: Performance meets or exceeds reference implementations

## Tools & Dependencies

- **Lean 4.12.0+**: Core theorem prover
- **Mathlib** (if needed): Standard library for advanced proofs
- **Rust 1.75+**: Target language with const generics
- **Prusti** (optional): Rust verification framework
- **CBMC** (optional): Bounded model checking for critical properties

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Complex Proofs**: Start with simplified versions, gradually add complexity
2. **Performance**: Profile early, optimize generated code with unsafe blocks if needed
3. **Mathlib Issues**: Keep dependencies minimal, implement needed lemmas locally
4. **Code Generation**: Manual translation fallback if automatic generation fails

## Deliverables

1. **Verified Lean Specification**: Complete B+ Tree with all proofs
2. **Rust Library**: High-performance implementation with verified properties  
3. **Documentation**: Formal specification, proof sketches, usage examples
4. **Benchmarks**: Performance comparison with standard implementations
5. **Paper/Blog**: "Formally Verified B+ Trees: From Lean to Production Rust"

**Timeline**: 10 weeks total, with verified Rust code generation as the primary milestone.
